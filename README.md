# CatGame
This game was created for me to understand and establish skills related to game devolopment and object oriented programming. It is mademade with SDL2. I included SDL2 to make it simpler to launch. I use VLD, so "vld.h" include may need to be removed in 'ImageObject'.

Otherwise, just open the solution and compile to play the game!
